# React Movie Table App

Displaying movies with different genres, this app has pagination, sorting, filtering, like button and delete button. All built by ReactJS.

# Component Design

By implementing `stateless functional component` and `object destructuring`, we could potentially write code in a cleaner way, lifting the state to make multiple components share the same data.

## Component Interface

Setting the interface of the component and defining the default values. The interface is based on the data it should receive, and events it will raise.

## Reusable Components

Extracting low level elements into common components, this makes the code more clean and readable.
